### Summary

This is a really cool project that I'm working on to gain familiarity with a few principles, namely working with json,
accessing a third party API, connecting to a local database server (PostgreSQL), and, eventually, data visualization (
which will likely be in some form of a web application).  

### Future additions/Todos:

 - Breakdown collected data (analytics)
 - Display collected data (data visualization)
 - Query collected data (search algorithm)
 - Adjust for major scalability (mine information on all of reddit, for instance) with concurrency primitives in Go
 - Collect more data on more subreddits
 - Full blown mining operation
